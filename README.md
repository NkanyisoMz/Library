# 📚 Library 

This project is part of the **JavaScript Course** in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
The goal is to practice **object constructors, prototypes, DOM manipulation, and event handling** by building a simple library app.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new books using a **popup form** (`<dialog>`).
- Each book has:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Number of pages
  - Read/Unread status
- Books are displayed as **cards** with:
  - **Toggle button** to change read status (color-coded).
  - **Remove button** to delete the book.
- Each book has a **unique ID** generated with `crypto.randomUUID()` to ensure stable references.
- Clean, centered layout with **styled book cards**.
- No storage between reloads (as per project requirements).

---

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, responsive design)
- **JavaScript**

---
## 📖 Lessons Learned
- How to use **constructor functions / classes** to structure data.  
- The importance of **keeping logic (data) separate from display (DOM)**.  
- Using `event.preventDefault()` to stop form reloads.  
- Dynamically creating and updating DOM elements with JavaScript.  
- Managing unique book identifiers with `crypto.randomUUID()`.  
- Practicing **flexbox** and **hover effects** for UI.
